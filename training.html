        <h3>What You Can Do on the Training Page</h3>
        <p>
          On the Training page, visitors can choose from different ready-made sessions and
          drills. They might filter content by age group, time available, or specific skill,
          like “first touch” or “finishing.” Each session will show a warm-up, a main drill,
          and a game at the end so players can apply what they learned. Visitors can download
          or print these sessions to take them to the field. They can also watch short video
          explanations or simple diagrams that show where to place cones and how players
          should move.

        <h3>Information Needed to Use the Training Plans</h3>
        <p>
          To use the training plans successfully, visitors need to know a few basic details.
          They should understand how many players they have, how much time they can train,
          and what equipment is available, such as cones, balls, and goals. The site will
          help them by listing the required equipment and suggesting easy replacements when
          they do not have everything. For example, plastic bottles can replace cones. Each
          plan will also include recommended age ranges and difficulty levels, so users do
          not choose drills that are too hard or too easy for their team.
